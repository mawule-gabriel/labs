# Matrix Multiplication Program

This program performs the multiplication of two matrices, A and B, and stores the result in a third matrix, C. The program is designed to accept user input for matrix dimensions and the individual matrix elements, then computes the matrix product according to the matrix multiplication rules. Finally, the result matrix is displayed.


## Description

Matrix multiplication involves multiplying the components of two matrices row by column. When multiplying a matrix **A** of dimensions *(n, m)* with a matrix **B** of dimensions *(m, p)*, the resulting matrix **C** will have dimensions *(n, p)*:

A(n,m) * B(m,p) = C(n,p)


## Features

- **Matrix Input:** Users are prompted to input the dimensions of two matrices and their elements.
- **Matrix Multiplication:** The program multiplies the two matrices according to the mathematical rules of matrix multiplication.
- **Error Handling:** The program checks for common errors, such as incompatible matrix dimensions, and prompts the user for valid input.
- **Matrix Output:** Displays the resulting product matrix after multiplication.

The program will prompt you to enter the dimensions and elements of the two matrices. After entering the data, the result of the matrix multiplication will be displayed.
