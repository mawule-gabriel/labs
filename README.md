# **Student Grade Statistics and Bar Chart**

This program allows you to input the grades of **N students** for an assignment, where **N** is the number of students. It stores the grades in an array and performs several tasks:

### **1. Calculates and displays:**
- **The maximum grade** in the class.
- **The minimum grade** in the class.
- **The average grade** of the class.

### **2. Generates a statistical distribution:**
- It categorizes the grades into **5 ranges** (0-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80, and 81-100) and stores the count of grades within each range in an array called `stats`.

### **3. Displays a bar chart:**
- A **graphical representation** of the grade distribution is created using `#######` symbols for each grade range, with the counts from the `stats` array. 
- The **grade ranges** are also labeled below the graph for clarity.

This program is a useful tool for visualizing and summarizing students' performance based on the assignment scores, providing both **statistical details** and a **visual bar graph** of the grade distribution.
