# Peak-Column Finder

## Description

The goal of this project is to search a given 2D matrix for elements that are both:

1. The **maximum** value in their respective row.
2. The **minimum** value in their respective column.

These elements are called **peak-columns**. The program will identify and display the positions and values of all peak-columns found in the matrix.

## Key Features

- **Input Matrix**: The user provides a matrix to be processed.
- **Peak-Column Identification**: The program searches for elements that satisfy the peak-column criteria (maximum in their row and minimum in their column).
- **Output**: The positions (row, column) and the corresponding values of the peak-columns are displayed.

## Example Input and Output

### Input:
Matrix A:
[ 10, 20, 15]
[ 22, 25, 30]
[ 5, 1, 4 ]

### Output:
Peak-Columns Found:
- Position (1, 1): Value 20
- Position (2, 2): Value 30
